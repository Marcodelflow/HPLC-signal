"""This script changes the names of the chromatograms allocated as csv in a given directory. 
In my case, the data extracted from the HPLC software present a format that i don't like,
so i made this program to extract the main sample name, add the number of the replicated,
and change the name of each file for easy processing.

example:
    MV__21072023 M0_011 (10).csv    has been renames as      M0_02.csv
    MV__21072023 M0_012 (10).csv    has been renames as      M0_04.csv
    MV__21072023 M0_013 (10).csv    has been renames as      M0_06.csv
